BasinExplorerFE is the FrontEnd of the Basin Explorer project. This project was created for demonstration of my skills. The idea behind this project is to create a portal where user can view Geographic information of river basin the area. There can be two types of user with different level of privileges and only high level users shall be able to access full data. The data is coming from REST APIs which can be highly dynamic and any change in data can be reflected on the portal.

The project was built using `React`
